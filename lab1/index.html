                                            Only 93 graduates received the certificates - it was very hard to study,
                                            especially payment, revolution were expanding. First graduates of KPI
                                            were presented with breast Toksnof graduate along with certificates.

                                            Already from 1899 the movement for creation of fifth, aeronautic
                                            department of KPI began and it was leaded by one of the biggest
                                            enthusiasts of aviati8n professor Mykola Artsmiyev, talanted apprentice
                                            of Mykola Jukovskyi. From his initiative aeronautic section within KPI
                                            mechanical club was organized in 1905-1906. Professor Stepan Timoshenko
                                            became the first honorable chief of section and student of mechanic
                                            department Victorin Bobrov became its vice-chief. In September 1908
                                            section was reorganized into aeronautic club with airplanes,
                                            helicopters, and engines departments. KPI professor Mykola Delone (son
                                            of the pioneer of aviation Boris Delone) was passionate propagandist of
                                            aviation and gliding idea, who became one of the founders of Kyiv
                                            aeronautic community (KAC). Exactly KAC was the first aviation nucleus,
                                            in work of which participated professors, engineers, constructors and
                                            KPI students who were speaking with lectures on aviation, building and
                                            testing flying vehicles, gliders.

                                            Inalienable page of KPI history is its participation in antidemocratic
                                            movement of the country, which was performed under slogan of
                                            democratization of high schools, freedom of students communities.
                                            Already in spring 1899, i.e. at first year of existence of university,
                                            its alumni took part in All-Russian student strict, directed against
                                            reaction Policy of government. Governments answer was expulsion,
                                            detention and exile of 32 students - organizers and active participants
                                            of the strike. But it was not the last student riot and students were
                                            participating in all tempestuous events of the beginning of 20th
                                            century.

                                            In the summer of 1918 the fifth faculty was created – the electro
                                            technical. Classes at the institute stopped and continued in correlation
                                            to the progress of the war in Kiev. Social transformations of the
                                            country were equally represented in the fundamental changes of the
                                            university governance principles.

                                            After the revolution and civil war it was imperative to rebuilt the
                                            economy of Ukraine, and a number of industries had to be created or
                                            restored, among them: machine-building engineering, machine tool
                                            engineering, automotive industry, chemical industry, defense sector,
                                            tractor engineering, metallurgy and others, it was necessary renew the
                                            old and build new businesses and technically re-equip them. To meet
                                            these requirements of the national plan the engineering intellectuals
                                            had to be trained in a short period of time. This important task was
                                            entrusted on different universities of the country including the Kyiv
                                            Polytechnic Institute, which was renamed to Industrial in 1934.

                                            In June in 1941 KPI concluded 43 th academic year. The Institute had
                                            3,000 students, more than 300 faculty members and the total number of
                                            the institute staff was about 5,000 people. Like in other universities,
                                            graduates defended their diploma works and received a job, students of
                                            the senior courses had manufacturing practices in various cities of the
                                            country, students of the junior courses had bridging exams. The War
                                            united everybody with a common goal - protecting the homeland.

                                            From the first days of the war, many lecturers and staff, graduates and
                                            students of the institute voluntarily and through mobilization joined
                                            the Red Army. They took part in the fighting on all fronts of the World
                                            War II. Graduates of the institute, who remained on the occupied
                                            territories participated in the underground and guerilla struggle.

                                            Late in June 1941 the Institute received orders to prepare for
                                            evacuation to Tashkent, where it functioned as a part of the Central
                                            Asian Industrial Institute.

                                            The liberation of Kyiv in November 1943 made it possible to reopen the
                                            institute: began the registration of the faculty members, staff and
                                            students that returned to the Institute. In the second half of January
                                            1944 the Selection Committee started its work of accepting first year
                                            students and renewal of the senior course students. All efforts of the
                                            institute was aimed at restoring educational material basis, because as
                                            a result of Nazi occupation and fierce battles for Kyiv more than a half
                                            of the total area of classrooms were destroyed, dormitories were burnt
                                            down and other property was looted. Because the Institute was included
                                            in the list of the most important industrial and transport universities
                                            of the country, students of all courses were exempted from draft into
                                            the Soviet Army and also were provided increased stipend (that concerned
                                            primarily students who studied foundry, forging, pressing and chemical
                                            production). Since the reconstruction works terms were constantly
                                            violated, in the summer of 1945 the students and teachers volunteered to
                                            do all urgent works during their month of holiday vacation.

                                            To improve the quality of training, the scientific research work and
                                            involvement of students, especially of the senior year, had great
                                            importance. The basic form of their involvement in research during the
                                            postwar years were scientific groups, and on its basis in April 1946 the
                                            student science and technology community was created. At the time of
                                            creation it had nine sections, which have united 30 groups of different
                                            specialties and about 500 students. The groups were directed by leading
                                            scientists of the institute.
